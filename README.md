First steps for the alphabank challenge.

Goal is to create a coin that will be created and added to a user's account when they do transactions with their cards.

This coin will be a cryptocurrency and so the use of a blockchain will be needed

Steps done so far: 
    Learn about blockchain and cryptocurrency

Steps that need doing: 
    Learn how to use alphabank API 
    Learn how a cryptocurrency can be generated (at least virtually)
    Connect the blockchain with the API's transactions 

Things worthy of rememberance: 

    Mining is the process by which miners solve cryptographically hard puzzles to find blocks to add to the blockchain. For mining these blocks, the miners get a reward called the block reward.

    Proof-of-work is the method of mining and consensus that is used in many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. We are going to be using proof-of-work in our blockchain.
    Proof Of Work Protocol: 
            1. The miners solve cryptographic puzzles to “mine” a block in order to add to the blockchain.
            2. This process requires immense amount of energy and computational usage. The puzzles have been designed in a way which makes it hard and taxing on the system.
            3. When a miner solves the puzzle, they present their block to the network for verification. 
            4. Verifying whether the block belongs to the chain or not is an extremely simple process.
